    <p class="loerum">Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the graphic, print, and publishing industries for previewing layouts and visual mockups Its origins were discovered by Richard McClintock, a Latin Scholar from Hampden-Sydney College. According to his research, Lorem Ipsum dates back to 45 BC, from Classical Latin literature.The words in the text originated from the book De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The ends of Good and Evil). The series of books was a treatise on the theory of ethics and was written by the ancient Roman philosopher and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero.The placeholder text was taken from the first book's discourse on hedonism. Its original text is a lot more cohesive than the modern version. The treatise was very popular during the Renaissance period, and it compelled a great many intellectuals and luminaries of the time to read the books.</p>
